1. why we need DBMS?
   data is crucial for any business and it needs to be structured, mainitained and analyzed
olden times, we used to files
Modern time, digital needs to be structured. 
Data is structured information
We store data in Databases
DBMS allows to read,update,delete the databases

2. Types of DataBases:
There are two kinds of DBMS 
  - - RDBMS(relational database management system)
         -- stores the data in tables
         -- easy to use, difficult to store
         -- relations can be well maintained 
Eg:  MySQL,oracle,sql server,sql lite, postgresql
 - - Non - Relational DBMS
        -- huge, easy to store and fast
        -- documents,objects,trees,graphs
Eg: mongoDB, couchDB,cassandra,radis,Apache

MySQL is a DBMS which is used to create,read,update,delete databases.
SQL is a language used to do operations using mySQL
